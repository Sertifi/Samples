## These samples include:
-   Steps on creating automated background signature/payment flows via two paths
    1.  EContractParameters
    2.  Standard Sertifi Custom Objects
- We always recommend attempting EContractParameters first before attempting using our Standard Sertifi Custom Objects.
	1. EContractParameters allows the use of Files, but you lose access to custom object fields.
	2. Standard Sertifi Custom Objects allows control over fields.
		 > If sending out documents for signature, Standard Sertifi Custom Objects only supports Attachments.
	3. Use a combination of the two if you need Files for content management and field control for implementing business logic.
