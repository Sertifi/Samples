## This sample includes:

* Two Apex snippets
    1. OneCallCreateObjects- creates all necessary objects required for sending.
    2. OneCallSendForSignature- uses our API call to send a complete contract to Sertifi for synchronization.

## Use cases:

* To create an automatic one-click button to send an Econtract.
* To automatically create objects and wait for approval before sending.
* To create triggers that fire off an Econtract for signature after a field is completed.
